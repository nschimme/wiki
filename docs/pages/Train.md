The **train** command has three different purposes.

You can use it to refresh one or more skills, in order not to forget
them:

`>train `[`fireball`](./fireball.md)
`>train all`

Or you can use it to stop exercising in a given skill, so that you will
eventually forget it:

`>train off `[`dodge`](./dodge.md)

This is quite useful to decay certain constantly used skills, like
dodge.

If you later "train dodge", "train on dodge", "prac dodge" or "learn
dodge", you will resume training in the skill, and it won't decay
anymore (if you keep using it, that is).

Skills in which you are not training anymore are marked by an asterisk
in the practice list:

`Skill / Spell          Knowledge  Difficulty Class      `[`Mana`](./Mana.md)`  Casting time`
[`Cure light`](./Cure_Light.md)`           * Superb     Normal     `[`Cleric`](./Cleric.md)`       10  Very short`
`                     ^`
`                Not refreshed`

Finally, 'train' can be used to improve some of your base
[abilities](./abilities.md) at the expense of others. For example:

`> train improve strength`
`> train neglect constitution`
`> train maintain perception`
`> train revert will`

Once you choose some abilities to improve and some abilities to neglect,
your statistics will start changing in the direction you required. The
change is slow (it should take about one RL month to see some effects)
and it is impossible to improve or worsen your stats too far from their
starting point. The order in which you improve or neglect your stats is
irrelevant. You cannot train stats beyond the limits of your
[race](./race.md).

The 'train status' command shows your current choices.

NOTE: Unlike [rerolls](./reroll.md), training does not affect your
[practice](./practice.md) percentages. The percentage to which you
can practice a skill is only based on your reference abilities.
