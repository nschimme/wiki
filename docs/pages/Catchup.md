Syntax: **catchup** \[&lt;number&gt;\|&lt;name&gt;

This command is used to mark all messages on a bulletin board up to the
number given as read. It can only be used in a [room](./room.md)
with a bulletin [board](./Boards.md) (but see also
[news](./News.md)).

Mark all messages on a bulletin board up to &lt;number&gt;, or all messages
written by &lt;name&gt;, as read. If you do not specify a parameter, all the
messages are marked as read. If &lt;number&gt; is negative, mark all messages
except the last \&lt;-number\&gt; messages as read.

Example:

` > catchup 14201`
