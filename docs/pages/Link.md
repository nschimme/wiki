**Link** is a command which shows information about your connection. It
will show round-trip time (best guess), and what options are active on
your connection.

The following options are possible (they are decided by your OS):

- sack : Selective acknowledgement - improves performance if you are
  experiencing packet loss.

<!-- -->

- timestamp: Provides accurate timestamps. If you do not have the
  timestamp option active, the round-trip time will be estimated a bit
  higher (up to 200ms) than what it really is.

<!-- -->

- wscale: Window scaling - support larger windows. Can improve
  performance in spammy situations if you have a slow link, or if you
  are doing local editing on big files.

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could
be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a fight, but some of
the cowards amongst players would like to cheat and cut their link when
things turn badly. This is how it works in [MUME](./MUME.md):

1\. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to
[flee](./flee.md) each time someone attempts to hit you. If you
are not fighting, you will [rent](./rent.md) automatically after a
period of time. The rent cost is then several times higher than the
normal rent. Your character will be saved automatically when your link
breaks.

2\. If your link jams (freezes) you have a problem. The only solution we
can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

3\. If your link freezes, or more generally if MUME doesn't receive any
commands from you for a certain amount of time, your character will
disappear into the void, and will reappear in the same spot when you
return. Having recently met a player-controlled enemy makes the void
delay considerably longer.
