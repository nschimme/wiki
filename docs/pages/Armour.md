Wearing **armour** lowers damage received. Two numbers are important
here: absorb and max. Absorb is the relative % of damage the armour
takes. However, the max determines the maximum amount of damage per hit
the armour can absorb. If the % of the damage to be absorbed is greater
than the max, only the max is absorbed.

## Armour Types

The basic armour come in four types: cloth, soft leather, rigid leather,
chain mail, and metal.

These types come in three levels (except cloth): normal, sturdy, and
fine. Sturdy and fine provide less penalties and more protection than
normal, fine being the best.

### Cloth

Cloth adds to db ([dodge bonus](./Dodge_bonus.md)), but has no
bonus to armour. Most plain clothes are as good as they can get, but of
note are grey tunic (higher than average db) and white robe
(db+spellsave).

### Leather

Soft leather has low abs percent and low max absorb values. Rigid
leather has high abs percent and low max absorb values. Certain leather
items gives an offensive bonus, some warriors keep an offensive set for
those occasions when high offensive bonus is a must and can switch from
metal to leather very quickly.

### Chain

Chain mail has low abs percent and high max absorb value. There are also
a few other armour items of note. Scale mail has similar max absorb to
chain mail but higher abs percent. White chain mail has similar abs
percent to chain mail but higher max absorb value. Shining chain mail
has lower abs percent than normal chain mail but significantly higher
max absorb value.

### Metal

Plate armour has high abs percent and high max absorb value. Also of
note: metal sets do not have a particular helmet. Good choices of metal
plate helmets are a large visored helmet (semi-artifact), a
horse-crested helm, a great helm, a spiked metal helmet, or a full metal
helmet or ancient metal helmet. Shining plate mail has the highest
protection of any of the armour.

## Magic Armour and Sanc

The following spells also reduce incoming damage:

- [Armour](./Armour_Spell.md): Works as a separate layer of
  absorption. Magic armour has an absorption percent but unlike physical
  armour it has no max per hit. Rather there is a cumulative capacity,
  i.e. after a certain amount of damage the effect of the spell will
  expire.
- [Sanctuary](./Sanctuary.md): Sets an upper limit of damage per
  hit

## Miscellaneuous

The way how incoming damage is processed appears to be as follows:

- reduce by the absorption of the armour spell (if present)
- the remainder is capped against the sanctuary spell (if present)
- the remainder is reduced by the absorption of the physical armour

There is a modifier that increases the chance to hit weakly armored body
parts vs better armored ones. The modifier depends mostly on the
perception stat of the attacker. This mechanism
means that the average effect of mixing strong and weak armour is less
than the average of its parts, because the weak armour spots are
primarily hit. It is thus recommended to wear similar armour on all body
parts.

### Armor Stats

- PR - parry bonus (for shields and bucklers) in %
- OB - offensive bonus in %
- DB - dodge bonus in %
- Abs. - absorb % of incoming damage
- to - maximum HP absorbed for each hit
