**Mudlle** (MUD Language for Little Extensions) is the online
programming language designed especially for [MUME](./MUME.md).

It allows the creation of intelligent [mobiles](./Mobile.md),
[rooms](./room.md), and objects. One example of a mudlled object
is the whetstone (if you are lucky enough to find one). Mudlle is quite
similar to the programming language Scheme (a Lisp dialect).

## Example code

This mudlle program on a mobile would cause it to repeat anything said
by a player in the same room:

module \[ \| repeat \| // Define repeat as a local variable repeat = fn
(me, who, verb, args) \[ if (verb == CMD_SAY && !is_mobile?(who)) \[ //
The one who said something not a mobile. actor = me; say (args) ; ;
react_event (repeat, "Function that makes a mob repeat says",
event_command);
