To get your favourite MUD in ANSI colour, use the "change colour"
command.

You can change the colour settings for either of the following fields:
damage narrate song zonebad emote normal status zoneevil enemy pray tell
zonegood hit say weather zoneneutral look shout yell zonenice
roomdescription To see the current colour setting for one of the fields,
use: \> change colour \&lt;field\&gt;

where &lt;field&gt; is one of the above. To actually change it, use: \> change
colour \&lt;field\&gt; \&lt;attribute\&gt;

The &lt;attribute&gt; may be one of "none" (no colour), "default" (the MUME
built-in standard colour) or "monochrome" (the MUME built-in standard
monochrome settings).

You can also specify your own colour setting. Then the &lt;attribute&gt;
consists of zero or more of "bold", "inverse", "underline" and "blink",
optionally followed by a colour, optionally followed by the keyword "on"
and a background colour.

The colours available are: black red green yellow blue magenta cyan
white BLACK RED GREEN YELLOW BLUE MAGENTA CYAN WHITE If you write the
colour using capital letters (BLACK, BLUE etc) you get a high intensity
version of the colour.

Here are a few examples: \> cha col look bold green make room names
appear in bold green \> cha col narr underline make narrates appear
underlined \> cha col song default make songs appear in the default
colour (yellow) \> cha col hit GREEN on red make hits show in high
intensity green on a red background The "normal" field is mostly useful
for people with bad terminal programs that don't reset colours properly.
Setting the colour to anything but "none" will make all text from the
game be forced into a certain colour. So if you have problem with
colours "bleeding" into places where they don't belong, try "cha col
norm white on black" (or whatever setting you prefer).

You can also set groups of fields to one of the "none", "default" or
"monochrome" settigs using \> cha col \&lt;group\&gt;
none\|default\|monochrome

where &lt;group&gt; can be one of the following: all all the fields
communications the pray, say, shout, song, tell and yell fields fights
the damage and hit fields zones the zonebad, zoneevil, zonegood,
zoneneutral and zonenice fields (used by the "map" command) For example:
\> cha col all default set all colours to the default values \> cha col
fight none turn off colours in fights \> cha col comm mono make
communications appear in monochrome You can also toggle the use of
colours on and off, overriding the settings above. This is done with
"change colour on" and "change colour off".
